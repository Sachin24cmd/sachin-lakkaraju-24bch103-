Write following programs considering list in mind:
1. Create a list of 5 odd integers using random nos. Similarly create a list of 4 even integers using
random nos. Replace the third element of odd integers with a list of 4 even integers. Flattern, sort
and print the list. Provide appropriate message at each stage.
2. Generate 20 random integers and store them in a list. Accept a number from the user and print
position of all occurrences of that number in the list.
3. Generate 50 random numbers in the range 1 and 30. Remove all duplicate values from the list.
4. Generate 30 random numbers and put them in a list. Create two more lists – one containing only
+ve numbers and another with –ve nos.
5. A list contains 5 strings. Convert all these strings to uppercase.
6. Convert list of temperatures in Fahrenheit degrees to equivalent Celsius degrees.
7. Write a menu-driven program to implement the stack data structure.
8. Write a menu-driven program to implement the Queue data structure.
9. Take two lists of numbers. Create third list of numbers for only those numbers from first list which
are not there in 2
nd list (use list comprehension).
